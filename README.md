# FORT CHESS

**Date:** *14th of September, 2022*.

This was a game I came up with as a child. I was looking to create my own rust project and
wonderd if I could turn my game idea into reality. So here we are. I hope you enjoy it.

> Note: This game is open-source and free to use, re-engineered or re-used however you like.
You are also welcomed to contribute to this and rest of my repositories.

### Rules:

    1.   This is a mini-game made in rust called fort chess.

    2.   You need 2-4 players to play this game.

    3.   There are a total of 75 boxes. 25 in each quadrant (24 + 1 inside fort).

    4.   Three players (fort attackers) have 2 knights and 6 Pawns.

    5.   One player (fort defender) has 4 Knight, 2 Rook, 3 Minister, 3 Queen and 12 Pawns
         evenly distributed across the boards.

    6.   There is no king. They are all sleeping peacefully while their soldiers bleed(realistic?).

    7.   The players cannot cross-over to the other player's boards.

    8.   The defending player defeats the attacking players by reaching the border of the attacking
         player's board.

    9.   The defending player loses if the attacking player reaches to the center of the fort.

> To Win: In order to win the game, the defender must either defeat all the players or the 
attacking player must reach the center of the fort and roll the dice to get 6.

Some ideas to re-impliment this code into your own project:

     -  Turn this game into online multiplayer.

     -  Make a full blown out 3d-version of this game.

     -  Add AI bots for opponents.

     -  Make a terminal version of this game with only ASCII graphics.

     -  Make this game cross-platform and port it to Android/IOS.
