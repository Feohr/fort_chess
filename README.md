**Date:** *14th of September, 2022*.

This was a game I came up with as a child. I was looking to create my own rust project and
wonderd if I could turn my game idea into reality. So here we are. I hope you enjoy it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Rules:

    1.  This is a mini-game made in rust called fort chess.

    2.  You need 2-4 players to play this game.

    3.  There are a total of 75 boxes. 25 in each quadrant (24 + 1 inside fort).

    4.  Three players (fort attackers) have 2 knights and 6 Pawns.

    5.  One player (fort defender) has 4 Knight, 2 Rook, 3 Minister, 3 Queen and 12 Pawns
        evenly distributed across the boards.

    6.  There is no king. They are all sleeping peacefully while their soldiers bleed(realistic?).

    7.  The players cannot cross-over to the other player's boards.

    8.  The defending player defeats the attacking players by reaching the border of the attacking
        player's board.

    9.  The defending player loses if the attacking player reaches to the center of the fort.

> To Win: In order to win the game, the defender must either defeat all the players or the
attacking player must reach the center of the fort and roll the dice to get 6.
