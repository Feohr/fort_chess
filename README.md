-* ==============================
-*
-* This was a game I came up with as a child. I was looking to create my own rust project and
-* wonderd if I could turn my game idea into reality. So here we are. I hope you enjoy it.
-*
-* Note: This game is open-source and free to use, re-engineered or re-used however you like.
-* You are also welcomed to contribute to this and rest of my repositories.

-*
-* Rules:
-*
-*      *   This is a mini-game made in rust called fort chess.
-*
-*      *   You need 2-4 players to play this game.
-*
-*      *   There are a total of 80 boxes. 25 in each quadrant (24 + 1 inside fort).
-*
-*      *   Three players (fort attackers) have 2 knights and 4 Pawns.
-*
-*      *   One player (fort defender) has 4 Knight, 2 Rook, 3 Minister, 3 Queen and 12 Pawns
-*          Evenly distributed across the boards.
-*
-*      *   There is no king. They are all sleeping peacefully while their soldiers
-*          bleed(realistic?).
-*
-*      *   The players cannot cross-over to the other player's boards.
-*          // except the fort defender (only the queens and ministers are allowed to cross).
-*
-*      *   The defending player defeats the attacking players by reaching
-*          the border of the attacking player's board.
-*
-*      *   The defending player loses if the attacking player reaches to the center of the fort.
-*
-* To Win:
-*      *   In order to win the game, the defender must either defeat all the players or
-*          the attacking player must reach the center of the fort and roll the dice to get 6.

-*
-* Some ideas to re-impliment this code into your own project:
-*
-*      *   Make a full blown out 3d-version of this game.
-*
-*      *   Turn this game into online multiplayer.
-*
-*      *   Make this game adaptable with 2 compulsory opponents and rest as optional.
-*
-*      *   Add AI bots for opponents.
-*
-*      *   Make a terminal version of this game with only ASCII graphics.
-*
-*      *   Make this game cross-platform and port it to Android/IOS.
